## Project: **File IO and Exceptions**

### Author: Roger Wells

In this project, we created a command line application which takes advantage of Python’s built in capabilities for reading and writing files. We ran tests that had us open some files, read lines from a file, and extract some strings using regex.

The test that required parsing of a template was particularly challenging, as it required multiple regex commands.

To Run this code, clone the repository, then enter :

python3 **madlib_cli**

To run tests in the terminal, install pytest and run the pytest command in the **madlib_cli**/tests directory

The two ‘plays_solo’ tests are particularly interesting because they use decorators. They were also the most difficult tests to pass.

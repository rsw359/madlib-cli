In this project, we created a command line application which takes advantage of Pythonâ€™s built in capabilities for reading and writing files. We ran tests that had us open some files, read lines from a file, and extract some strings using regex.

The test that required parsing of a template was particularly challenging, as it required multiple regex commands.
